abstract = {The thermal stability of proteins can be used to assess ligand binding in living cells. We have generalized this concept by determining the thermal profiles of more than 7000 proteins in human cells by means of mass spectrometry. Monitoring the effects of small-molecule ligands on the profiles delineated more than 50 targets for the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. We identified the heme biosynthesis enzyme ferrochelatase as a target of kinase inhibitors and suggest that its inhibition causes the phototoxicity observed with vemurafenib and alectinib. Thermal shifts were also observed for downstream effectors of drug treatment. In live cells, dasatinib induced shifts in BCR-ABL pathway proteins, including CRK/CRKL. Thermal proteome profiling provides an unbiased measure of drug-target engagement and facilitates identification of markers for drug efficacy and toxicity.},

The N-hydroxycinnamide moiety is identified as critical for potent and tetrahydrobiopterin-competitive inhibition of phenylalanine hydroxylase leading to increases in phenylalanine and decreases in tyrosine levels. These findings provide a rationale for adverse clinical observations and suggest repurposing of the drug for treatment of tyrosinemia.},

@article{Franken2015,
abstract = {The direct detection of drug-protein interactions in living cells is a major challenge in drug discovery research. Recently, we introduced an approach termed thermal proteome profiling (TPP), which enables the monitoring of changes in protein thermal stability across the proteome using quantitative mass spectrometry. We determined the intracellular thermal profiles for up to 7,000 proteins, and by comparing profiles derived from cultured mammalian cells in the presence or absence of a drug we showed that it was possible to identify direct and indirect targets of drugs in living cells in an unbiased manner. Here we demonstrate the complete workflow using the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat. The key to this approach is the use of isobaric tandem mass tag 10-plex (TMT10) reagents to label digested protein samples corresponding to each temperature point in the melting curve so that the samples can be analyzed by multiplexed quantitative mass spectrometry. Important steps in the bioinformatic analysis include data normalization, melting curve fitting and statistical significance determination of compound concentration-dependent changes in protein stability. All analysis tools are made freely available as R and Python packages. The workflow can be completed in 2 weeks.},

@article{Childs2018,
abstract = {Determining the interaction partners of small molecules in the intact cellular context remains a key challenge in drug research. Thermal proteome profiling (TPP) addresses this need by inferring target engagement from changes in temperature-dependent protein denaturation at a proteome-wide scale. Existing approaches to TPP data analysis have been centered around a single parameter, the melting point. Target engagement is then identified from a compound induced change in this parameter. However, for a substantial number of proteins the melting point shift does not reflect the treatment effect well, or cannot be confidently estimated at all. To overcome these limitations, we present a non-parametric analysis of response curves (NPARC), a functional approach that compares entire curves instead of summary parameters. NPARC projects the data to a space of smooth functions and infers treatment effects by an F-statistic with degrees of freedom estimated from the data. We show that our method outperforms the currently used melting point-centric approach with regard to specificity and sensitivity on five independent datasets. NPARC reliably detected known cancer drug targets for which ligand binding was not reflected by melting point shifts. The proposed method works with arbitrary numbers of replicates, and comparisons can be defined in a flexible manner. We hope that the proposed approach will aid in the detection of novel targets and off-targets for drugs with to date unexplained mechanisms of action or side effects.},

abstract = {Characterizing the genome-wide dynamic regulation of gene expression is important and will be of much interest in the future. However, there is currently no established method for identifying differentially expressed genes in a time course study. Here we propose a significance method for analyzing time course microarray studies that can be applied to the typical types of comparisons and sampling schemes. This method is applied to two studies on humans. In one study, genes are identified that show differential expression over time in response to in vivo endotoxin administration. By using our method, 7,409 genes are called significant at a 1{\%} false-discovery rate level, whereas several existing approaches fail to identify any genes. In another study, 417 genes are identified at a 10{\%} false-discovery rate level that show expression changing with age in the kidney cortex. Here it is also shown that as many as 47{\%} of the genes change with age in a manner more complex than simple exponential growth or decay. The methodology proposed here has been implemented in the freely distributed and open-source edge software package.},
